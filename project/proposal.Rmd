### Data Preparation

```{r data-prep}
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data606/master/project/data/hate_crimes.csv")
region_mapping <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data606/master/project/data/region_mapping.csv") %>%
  # convert all headers to lowercase
  rename_all(funs(str_to_lower(.)))
```

#### Adding Qualitative Variables
```{r}
data %<>%
  left_join(region_mapping, by = "state")
```



### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**  

Are there more annual hate crimes per 100,000 population in areas where the greater share of the population voted for Trump in 2016?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**  

There are 51 cases, all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Each case has relevant statistics on hate crimes and vote results from the 2016 election.


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**  

The data collection was simple. The data source was posted on FiveThirtyEight's GitHub in a CSV format. That data was gathered from numerous sources including the Kaiser Family Foundeation, Census Bureau, United States Election Project, Souther Poverty Law Center, and the FBI.


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**  

This is an observational study as there it is just analyzing data on events that have occured.


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**  


[Data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv)  
[Region Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cphalpert/census-regions/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv)  



### Response 
**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**  

The response variable is average annual hate crimes per 100,000 population and it is a numerical variable.


### Explanatory 
**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**  

The explanatory variable is the share of the population in the state that voted for Trump in 2016. This is also a numerical variable.



### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**  

```{r}
summary(data)

one <- data %>%
  select(state, median_household_income, share_voters_voted_trump) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_household_income)) %>%
  head(5)

# top 5 median incomes
kable(one, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```


#### Visualizations
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi, col = region)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi), alpha = .6, shape = 16) +
  geom_abline()
```

#### Linear Model
```{r}
model <- lm(avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi ~ share_voters_voted_trump, data = data)
summary(model)
```

#### Multiplot
```{r}
p1 <- data %>%
  filter(region == "Northeast") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi), alpha = .6, shape = 16) +
  geom_abline()

p2 <- data %>%
  filter(region == "South") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi), alpha = .6, shape = 16) +
  geom_abline()

p3 <- data %>%
  filter(region == "Midwest") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi), alpha = .6, shape = 16) +
  geom_abline()

p4 <- data %>%
  filter(region == "West") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = share_voters_voted_trump, y = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = avg_hatecrimes_per_100k_fbi), alpha = .6, shape = 16) +
  geom_abline()

p1
p2
p3
p4
```

There does appear to be fairly weak positive relationship across all of the regions.
