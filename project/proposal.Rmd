### Data Preparation

```{r data, echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load data
data <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv") %>%
  read_csv()
```


### Research question 

**You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.**  

Are there more annual hate crimes per 100,000 population in areas where the greater share of the population voted for Trump in 2016?


### Cases 

**What are the cases, and how many are there?**  

There are 51 cases, all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Each case has relevant statistics on hate crimes and vote results from the 2016 election.


### Data collection 

**Describe the method of data collection.**  

The data collection was simple. The data source was posted on FiveThirtyEight's GitHub in a CSV format. That data was gathered from numerous sources including the Kaiser Family Foundeation, Census Bureau, United States Election Project, Souther Poverty Law Center, and the FBI.


### Type of study 

**What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?**  

This is an observational study as there it is just analyzing data on event that have occured.


### Data Source 

**If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.**  


[Data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv)
<https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv>



### Response 
**What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?**  

The response variable is average annual hate crimes per 100,000 population and it is a numerical variable.


### Explanatory 
**What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorival)?**  

The explanatory variable is the share of the population in the state that voted for Trump in 2016. This is also a numerical variable.



### Relevant summary statistics 

**Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.**  

```{r}
summary(data)

one <- data %>%
  select(state, median_household_income, share_voters_voted_trump) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_household_income)) %>%
  head(5)

# top 5 median incomes
kable(one, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```
